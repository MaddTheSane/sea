The workspace is designed to be built via the command line for distribution purposes.

This is due to the shear number of projects because of the plugins. From the command you can use a default xcconfig file - this option does not appear when using the XCode UI builds.

Here are the sample commands used (at the top-level directory)

for building for the App Store

xcodebuild archive -workspace seashore.xcworkspace/ -xcconfig Seashore.xcconfig -scheme "Seashore"

for building the stand-alone DMG

xcodebuild build -workspace seashore.xcworkspace/ -xcconfig Seashore.xcconfig -scheme "Seashore Disk Image"
