Seashore is now on the App Store !!! Please add your positive review there. Also, if you use it for your website, business, whatever, giving credit to Seashore and a link to the App Store will go a long way towards making the project survive and prosper.

[![Download](https://linkmaker.itunes.apple.com/en-us/badge-lrg.svg?releaseDate=2019-01-15T00:00:00Z&kind=desktopapp&bubble=macos_apps)](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/seashore/id1448648921?mt=12&app=apps)

You can also download the latest DMG releases [here](https://github.com/robaho/seashore/releases), **but these will no longer perform "update checks"** - since this requires the App Store - so you will need to periodically check for new releases !

**The current version requires 10.7+. If you are on an earlier OSX version, I suggest downloading the 0.6.6 binaries from seashore.sourceforge.net. Most likely you need to download the "hfs" version in order to open on an older Mac.**

Seashore was originally located at https://sourceforge.net/p/seashore and was the brainchild of Mark Pazolli.

This is the currently maintained version. The primary motivation was to allow Seashore to work on OSX 10.6+, including Sierra, and El Capitan, and so this originally only contained bug fixes.

Beyond the bug fixes, a lot of code refactoring was performed, including converted the application to ARC. Additionally, a few minor enhancements have been added.

If you are looking for an free, easy to use, image editing application with "layers", this is the one.

Here's a nice article (with screenshots) on the Seashore project at [Libre Graphics World](http://libregraphicsworld.org/blog/entry/meet-seashore-free-image-editor-for-macos)
