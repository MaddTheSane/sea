download the latest DMGs from https://github.com/robaho/seashore/releases

**The current version requires 10.7+. If you are on an earlier OSX version, I suggest downloading the 0.6.6 binaries from seashore.sourceforge.net.**

Seashore was originally located at https://sourceforge.net/p/seashore

This is the currently maintained version. The primary motivation was to allow Seashore to work on OSX 10.6+, including Sierra, and El Capitan, and so this originally only contained bug fixes.

Beyond the bug fixes, a lot of code refactoring was performed, including converted the application to ARC. Additionally, a few minor enhancements have been added.

If you are looking for an free, easy to use, image editing application with "layers", this is the one.
