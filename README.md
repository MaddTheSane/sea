download the latest DMGs from https://github.com/robaho/seashore/releases

seashore forked from https://sourceforge.net/p/seashore/code/HEAD/tree/

Primary motivation was to allow Seashore to work on OSX 10.6+, including Sierra, and El Capitan, and so this only contains bug fixes and new features will probably never be added.

If you are looking for an free, easy to use, "layers" image editing application, this is the one.
